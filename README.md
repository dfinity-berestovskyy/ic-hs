The IC Stub
===========

The IC stub is a partial implementation of the public interface of the DFINITY
Internet Computer, as specified in
https://docs.dfinity.systems/spec/public/
with the primary goal of providing a mock environment to test the output of the
Motoko compiler.

It currently provides one binary, `ic-stub-run`, that allows you to script the
execution of a single canister.

Status
------

This is neither complete nor authoritative. Since this is primarily meant for
testing the output of Motoko, code paths not exercised by Motoko may not be
present; in particular, error handling and input validation is incomplete.

Extra features
--------------

In order to support patterns useful for and used in the Motoko test suite, the
IC stub has some extra features that are not specâ€™ed or implemented in the
official client. These are:

 * The ability to create calls from `canister_init`.

 * The ability to create additional canisters, in a way where the creating
   canisters learns the id of the created canister synchronously, and can send
   messages to it right away.

   The interface for that is

      ic.create_canister : (mod_src : i32, mod_size : i32, arg_src : i32, arg_size : i32) -> (idx : i32)
      ic.created_canister_id_size : (idx : i32) -> (size : i32)
      ic.created_canister_id_copy : (idx : i32, dst : i32, offset : i32, size : i32) -> ()

   where the `idx` is only valid within the same function invokation.

Installation of `ic-stub-run`
-----------------------------

If you use the top-level `nix-shell`, you should already have `ic-stub-run` in
your `PATH`.

To install it into your normal environment, run from the top-level repository
directory.


    nix-env -i -f . -A ic-stub


Developing on ic-stub
---------------------

Running `nix-shell` in the `ic-stub/` directory should give you an environment
that allows you to build the project using `cabal new-build`.

The interpreter is too slow
---------------------------

The obvious performance issue with `winter`, according to profiling, is
evaluation under lambdas, the cost centres `step_Label7_k`, `step_Label7`,
`step_Label2` and `step_Framed4` are responsible for most allocation. Switching
to an interpreter form with a control stack would likely help a lot, but would
move `winter` away from being a straight-forward port of the Ocaml reference
interpreter `wasm`.
